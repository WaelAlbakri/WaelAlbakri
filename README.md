### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hello! My name is Wael (Some people call me Ahmed) and I work at a Science and Technology Museum based in San Antonio. I have an associate in Computer Science and I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems.

I'm currently studying Computer Science at The University of Texas at San Antonio and expect to graduate in 2025. My interests include Cybersecurity, Linux, and Software Development.

My hands-on experience at the San Antonio Science and Tech Museum and a strong foundation in programming languages like Python, C, and Java equip me to contribute effectively in fast-paced and technology-driven environments.

Passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, I am committed to continuous learning and professional development, participating in platforms like TryHackMe and BTLO to enhance my cybersecurity skills. Fluent in Arabic with basic proficiency in Turkish.

Thank you for visiting my repository!
